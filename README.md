## Personal test DNS blocklist
**NOT FOR USE IN PRODUCTION.**

This is my personal DNS blocklist, running as a test of AdGuard's `hostlist-compiler`. Do not use! This list is arbitrary, and liable to disappear soon.
This would be a private repo except I need plaintext access to the resulting text blocklist from CLI in an archaic system.
